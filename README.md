ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on projects involving LLM's, Generative AI, Mathematical and Statistical Modeling, and Machine Learning Algorithms
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently a Masters in Bioinformatics student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA.

As a graduate student, I'm deeply passionate about the intersection of machine learning, bioinformatics, statistics, and optimization. I enjoy applying advanced computational techniques to decipher the life sciences, and more. Some interests I have are exploring innovative algorithms for genomic analysis, optimizing models for drug discovery, and advancing personalized medicine through AI.

ðŸ”­ Some notable courses I've completed to familiarize myself with Machine Learning theory and applications:
* Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra by [_IBM Coursera_](https://coursera.org/share/27d669532422678f8de323556139c67c)*
* Machine Learning with Python by [_IBM Coursera_](https://coursera.org/share/a8659990dd60019a691ec3ccf244fa2e)*

Here are some of the many models I have used:
