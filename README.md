Iâ€™m an Applied Mathematics and Bioinformatics graduate student at Northeastern University in Boston, MA.
I'm deeply passionate about statistics, optimization, and their real-world applications. I enjoy leveraging advanced computational techniques to solve complex problems across diverse domains, including life sciences and finance. My interests range from developing innovative algorithms for genomic analysis and optimizing models for drug discovery, to applying AI and quantitative methods for portfolio optimization, risk modeling, and financial forecasting. Whether decoding biological systems or market dynamics, I'm driven by the pursuit of insightful, data-informed solutions.

Currently, I'm working on projects involving LLM's, Optimization, Mathematical and Statistical Modeling, and Deep Learning Algorithms




 My graduate coursework at Northeastern University to date includes:
* Machine Learning and Statistical Learning Theory
* Algorithms for Optimization
* Statistics in Bioinformatics
* Algorithms
* Probability and Statistics
* Computational Methods in Bioinformatics
* Bioinformatics Programming
* Differential Equations
* Linear Algebra
